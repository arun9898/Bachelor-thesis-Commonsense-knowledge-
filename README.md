# Bachelor-thesis-Commonsense-knowledge-
This project contains additional files which belong to my Bachelor's Thesis on the availability of Commonsense knowledge in Linked Data sets

These files are mentioned in my thesis, and are referred to from this thesis.

In the file "Thesis survey - questions", the complete survey can be found that I conducted in order to generate a commonsense knowledge domain for my research.

In the file "Thesis survey - answers", all survey answers can be found that I generated from conducting the survey.

In the file "Thesis survey - answers in split data sets", all survey answers can be found that I generated from conducting the survey. In this file, I also made the distinction between whether an answer was given by a male or female and whether an answer was given by a student/young adult or and Information science expert.

In the file "Clustering algorithm", the clusters can be found that were made by an independent subject. After applying the clustering algorithm, I applied the TAP (think aloud protocol) in order to find out why he made certain stept. The transcript of this conversation can be found in the file as well.

In the file "Results of online analysis and performance of data sets", all steps of the online analysis can be found. I also kept track of my clicks, and noted every click and URL of the page that I visited. After doing this, I calculated the average performance, and put these in a table which shows the performance of all 3 discusses data sets.
